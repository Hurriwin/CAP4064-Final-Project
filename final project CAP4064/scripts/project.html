                <h3>Capstone Project</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\adria\Documents\final project CAP4064\images\phone.png" alt="picture of phone" class="round">
                <p class="tablet-desktop">For my Capstone Project my group and I decided to create an app for the school that would help the students and the professors to schedule after class meetings with one another.</p>
                <p class="tablet-desktop">We decided to create the application for both PC and mobile users. </p> 
                <p class="tablet-desktop">For my portion of the project I worked as the database manager. My role was to implement the database for the application.</p>
                <p class="tablet-desktop">In total we had  6 members working on the project including myself.</p>
				<h4> Key fetures</h4>
				<ul>
                <li>Allowed direct and quick contact with professors</li>
                <li>App was available on PC and mobile devices</li>
                <li>Different indivual features for students and professors</li>
                <li>User interface was simple and easy to use</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h3>Database Management</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\adria\Documents\final project CAP4064\images\database.png" alt="screenshot of database tables" class="round">
                <p class="tablet-desktop">For the final project in my database management class my team had to create our own database. We chose to create our database on a daycare center.</p>
				<h4>Content in database</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Names of kids and parents</li>
                <li>Phone numbers of parents</li>
                <li>Age and names of both kids and parents</li>
                <li>Information on the staff of the daycare such as names, phone numbers, etc...</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="tablet-desktop">For this project we had to make sure that all the information we put in our database was non redundant, meaning no repeating information and the information 
				had to be unique.</p>
                <p class="tablet-desktop">There was 3 members in my group including myself.</p>
                <p class="tablet-desktop">We also had to make our database work with c++ meaning that we could give the prompts commands and it will execute them. For example, if we wanted to find
				the name of a parent using their phone number we could enter the command to do so and it will return the name of that parent.</p>
            </article>

                <h3>C++ Coding Project</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\adria\Documents\final project CAP4064\images\code.png" alt="programm of c++" class="round">
                <p class="tablet-desktop">For the final project of fundamentals of programming my partner and I had to make a progam in c++ that would recieve x and y cordinates from the user and mark
				the location with an "X" on a grid plane</p>
				<h4>Key Features</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Could recall the location of previous locations given to the program</li>
                <li>Can move the "X" by a certain amount of units when you give it the input</li>
                <li>Can save current location to use later on</li>
                <li>Has an undo feature to revert to a certain position</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="tablet-desktop">My and my partner created the program only using c++ and was a good project to utilize everything we learned in that class.</p>
